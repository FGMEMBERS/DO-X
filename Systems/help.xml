    _________ Engine control between Pilot and Engineer __________
    
    In the Middle Panel between the pilot and copilot seat 
    you see 12 lamps. 6 left for the larboard engines.
    6 right for the starboard engines.
    The two instruments show you the average rpm of all locked
    engines.
    
    Red      - engine off
    Yellow   - engine is running but not locked to the two little 
    throttle gears of the pilot. Only the engineer
    have the control for this engine in that moment.
    The clutch lever to lock and unlock those engines
    you will find in the Engineer Cabin.
    Green    - pilot have full control over this engine.
    
    ________________ Navigation with RDF and NDB __________________
    
    Switch view between Pilot and Radio Navigation Officer with Ctrl-R.
    In the Radio Cabin you will find a RDF-panel. First you have to set
    a NDB, ILS or VOR/DME -frequency in range. Switch on the Instrument with the 
    little knob AN/AUS. Fit on the headset and turn the DREHWINKEL-SCHEIBE
    to find the loudest volume of the beacon-signal you have set.
    If you have found the max. volume, click the pencil
    below the RDF-panel.
      
    _______________________________________________________________
    
    Takeoff speed is around 80 kts.
